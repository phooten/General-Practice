Goals:
    -   Be able to build multiple files in a current folder from vs Code. Right 
        now it works only if there is one .cpp file. Other wise I'm better off
        using makefiles, which isn't bad, it would just be nice to do either. 



Hotkeys:
    ctrl + shift + b:   builds the program. 

    ctrl + up/down:
        Moves 5 lines at once. Coppied this into keybindings.json 
            {
                "key": "ctrl+up",
                "command": "cursorMove",
                "args": {
                    "to": "up",
                    "by": "line",
                    "value": 10
                },
                "when": "editorTextFocus"
            },
            {
                "key": "ctrl+down",
                "command": "cursorMove",
                "args": {
                    "to": "down",
                    "by": "line",
                    "value": 10
                },
                "when": "editorTextFocus"
            },



Tips:
    Compiilers:
        There are 9 compilers to choose from including: g++, cpp, gcc etc. which 
        are mostly in /usr/bin or /bin. to configure the default in msvs Code, 
        got to Terminal > Configure Default Build Task, and select the compiler.
        You should be able to use the hot key and then press "f5" to run the 
        executable. 
    
    files.exclude:
        files -> preferences -> settings -> seach: "file exclude"
