DeepCopy:
    Exact replica of something. Complete replication and no sharing of memory

std::move():
    "this is a direct transfer of content". This is also known as an "Xvalue". 
    This treats any value as an rvalue. If you do end up using this, be careful
    about using an lvalue that has been move()'d. There will be no warning. 


Why are these important?
    When we don't really need or want to copy someone from one place to another
    these become useful. For instance, when copying a string into a function or 
    object.
