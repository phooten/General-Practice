		- created skeleton code: basic functions and structure 
 [8/30/2021] : 10:50 PM
		-   worked through my self to try and figure this out after reading a basic
 			description and pseudo code. I got the partition easily, but I couldn't
			conceptually understand how to go about sorting the array without altering the 
			original array. I was close in my thought process but couldn't pull it 
			together completeley. In the end I studied "interviewbit.com"'s code and 
			got it to work. I feel I have a good understanding about this algorithm now.
