    -   I am currently learning how to make a Graph data structure.
        Once this is complete, i will move back to this algorithm 
        to finish.

    -   This is NOT optimal in the slightest, but it works. At least for the 8 
        node graph. I'll come back to this.

    Next Steps:
        -   Test different starting points
        -   Finish commenting, organizing, and cleaning up debugging code
        -   Make a way to input graphs easier and test with different graphs 
        -   Optimize the code
