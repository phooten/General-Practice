    -   Wrote the skeleton of the program which relied on GeeksForGeeks. Random
		generator is functioning.

    -   Finished the program. The random generated numbers can still be 
        adjusted to function more randomly, but everything else appears to 
        be working. I was thinking the next branch of this code I'll try to 
        use a doubly linked list rather than an array.
