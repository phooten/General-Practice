-   **variant a**   
    -   Overview: 
        -   My implementation of vecotrs. It can definitley be improved, but it's 
            a good starting point. It was built with the intention of using it 
            for learning about the standard library, and I wrote before
            reading / learning about vectors.

-   **tutorial**   
    -   Overview: 
        -   Code and notes I wrote while watching ['the cherno' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryRf4Jh_YC0)
            and ['Tec with Tim' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzzE2wnnlo). 
            It is not the same but code probably looks very similar.
