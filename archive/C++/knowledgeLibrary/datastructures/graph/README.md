-   **variant a:**   
    -   Overview: 
        -   My implementation of Graphs. It can definitley be improved, but it's a good
            starting point. It was built with the intention of using it for learning 
            different algorithms
    -   Examples used in: 
        -   [Dijkstra's Algorithm - Variant a](C++/knowledgeLibrary/algorithms/dijkstra/variant%20a)
    -   [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/_co39xOhJGk) (how 'variant a' can be used)
