Vectors
=======

# Overview
This folder is dedicated to learning about the standard C++ library 'vectors'
and how they work. 


# Table of Contents
-   **variant a**   
    -   Overview: 
        -   My implementation of vecotrs. It can definitley be improved, but it's 
            a good starting point. It was built with the intention of using it 
            for learning about the standard library, and I wrote before
            reading / learning about vectors.

-   **tutorial**   
    -   Overview: 
        -   Code and notes I wrote while watching ['Paul Programming' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6YWN4W-jk&list=PLTxllHdfUq4f7-uHOpxXnBUbsuLiI9pmb&index=12)
            It is not the same but code probably looks very similar.
        -   Need to fix:
            -   Global variables in hashTable.cpp
            -   Brush up comments and syntax
