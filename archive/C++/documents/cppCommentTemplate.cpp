    Important Tips:
        - Use Liceanse Boiler plate at the beginning of the file
        - Don't go past column 80 
        - Never use tabs. Configure tab to use spaces (4).

    Efficiency Comment [ 9-28-2021 ]:
                    I know this sorting is very in-efficient with run time and 
                    space. This will never take in more than 4 inputs or be used
                    in a serious program.

    Purpose:        To complete hackerrank challenge surrounding for functions.
                    The problem statement can be found here: 
                    https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-functions/problem

    sample input:
                    "sampleInput.txt"  
    
    Questions to think about:
        1. What is the difference between a vector and set?
