GENERAL 
===============

General is a personsl collections and storage base for learning coding concepts and languages. It is not meant for anything
other than a learning tool, but I wanted to make it public for anyone interested. Some of this code will be based on tutorials 
and articles, some will be completley written by me, and some will be a mixture of both. I try my best to make it clear 
and link to the original code when it is being used.
