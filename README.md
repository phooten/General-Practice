### Description
This repository is a personal collection and storage base for learning coding concepts and languages. It is not meant for anything
other than a learning tool, but I wanted to make it public for anyone interested. Some of this code will be based on tutorials 
and articles, some will be completley written by me, and some will be a mixture of both. I try my best to make it clear 
and link to the original code when it is being used. This will probably never be completed. 


### Quick References
Concepts I found interesting AND are documented enough to be referenced: 

* [**Vector Datastructure [ c++ ]**](C++/knowledgeLibrary/datastructures/graph/)
* [**Graph Datastructure [ c++ ]**](C++/knowledgeLibrary/datastructures/graph/)
* [**Dijkstra's Algorithm [ c++ ]**](C++/knowledgeLibrary/algorithms/dijkstra/)
* [**Brave Miner [ BASH ]**](BASH_SCRIPTS/braveMiner/)
