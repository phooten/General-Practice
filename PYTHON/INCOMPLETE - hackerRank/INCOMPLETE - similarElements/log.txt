     - Most of the code is completed with ease. Ran into a transitivity matching issue. I can't 
		seem to complete this without a massive chunk of code.

     - still having issues with the transitivity portion. I forsee an issue where the number of 
		of matches will out number what I have alloted for the array

     - Found another way to add dynamically add to matches list AND nest lists, helping with keep
		track of pairs. Transitiviy checking doesn't account for the first element of the 
			first element in pairs() i.e. pairs[0][0]
