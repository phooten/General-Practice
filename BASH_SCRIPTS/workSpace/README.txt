Overview:
    I've discovered powerToys for windows which seems really usefull. I want to 
    write a program that opens:
    
        -   WSL (Two windows)
            -   one opens up to /General, and the other opens to ~/
        
        -   Spotify

        -   VScode
            -   folders tab opens up to /General, or what ever project I've last 
                worked on
            -   (SOLUTION FOUND) Terminal goes to what ever the folder is tab opned up to
                    solution: right click -> Open in integrated terminal
        
        -   Brave Browser (Two windows)
    
    From here I would like each to snap into the correct position on the screen
    that was set up in powerToys
