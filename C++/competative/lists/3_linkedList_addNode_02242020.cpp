	Purpose:	To learn more about C++, pointers, and linked lists. Create functions to insert
				nodes at the begining and end of a linked list.
	Language:	C++
	NOTE:		Alot of this code came from the website (below) meant as a template:
				_____________________________________________________________________________

				LINK:     https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/linked-list-insertion/1
				____________________________________________________________________________
				This is meant for practice, and the problem statement on the site was 
				completed entirely on my own.

// Status: INCOMPLETE - [2/27/2020] - [40.ish minutes]
//						[2/24/2020] - [2.ish hours]
//
//							   Total:  2.66 hours

// Log:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// [2/24/2020]
//		- Somewhat of a continuation on "2_...2020.cpp". Ran code and got the first
// 		  linked list right, but also got a seg fault right after. I'll probably have
//		  to valgrind if I can't visually check my code, so I'm taking a break for tonight. 
//		  I have a much better grasp on this after drawing everything out. 
// [2/27/2020]
//		- The memory leak was caused on line 106: " while(tmpHead->next != NULL){ ... etc.
//		  When the "insertAtEnd" function was called and it was an empty list, there was
//		  No tmpHead->next, so it was accessing illeagal memory. I created an if statement 
//		  to counter this, but there is probably a better way to counter this. I'll probably 
//		  look into this next time I work on this. Other than that, the code runs well and 
// 		  I have a much better understanding of this code.
