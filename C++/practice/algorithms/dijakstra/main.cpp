    Notes:
        - Cannot be used if edges have negative weight
        - Versions: 
            - "Lazy" Dijkstra's
            - 

    Algorithm:
        - Initialize all distances to get to each node from node A to infinity
        - Assign start node to be 0
        - Visit all nodes directly attached to node 0, and reassign shortest distances IF they are shorter
        - Visit the next most promising node in the priority queue
