Compile: 
	"gcc program-source-code.cpp < input.txt > output.txt"
		-> takes input from "input.txt"
		-> prints output in "output.txt"

	"gcc program-source-code.c -o executable-file-name"
		-> basic compile 

	"make executable-file-name"

	"g++ -g -Wall input.cpp -o executable"
		-> for gdb and warning messages

	"cc myth1.c -o executable -lm"
		-> for math functions

Running List of 'came up while working' Questions:
    -   what is the pros/cons and similarities/differences of:
            std::stirng arr[10]; 
            std::string* arr[10];
    -   How is data stored re allocated in the arr[] after initialized:

            std::string arr[10] = {" ", " ", ....}
            for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
                for(int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++)
                    arr[i] = 'A' + i;
    
    -   Why does this give me segfault?
            std::string* verticesListPtr[vLen];
            for(int i = 0; i < vLen; i++){
                *verticesListPtr[i] = 'A' + i;
                std::cout << *verticesListPtr[i] << " ";
            }
