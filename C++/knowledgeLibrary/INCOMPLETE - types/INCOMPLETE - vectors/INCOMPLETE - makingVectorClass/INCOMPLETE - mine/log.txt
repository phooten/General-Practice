    General Notes:
    -   Only working with an int, no other type def when declaring a vector class

    Done:
    -   .size() and .capacity()
    -   vector resizing (vector.upSize(), vector.downSize)
        -   working between array of size 1, to size 402653184 (2^29 * 3/4).

    Having issues with:
    -   vector.first() need to deal with the case of .first() = NULL
    -   vector.back() need to deal with it's special case of size = 0 vector
    -   overloading "<>" 

    Next Steps:
    -   Finish:
        -   vector.push_back() I have most of the basic code written, it just needs
            to be debugged and polished.

    -   Added "frontPosition()" and "backPosition" to help move through the array, 
        because front()/back() returns the value and not the address. 
    -   Completed front()/back() to function properly
    -   Updated a testing functions and printing the vector with all it 
        characteristics out. 
    -   Working on push_back when it goes to line 120: newVectorPtr = new int[newSize];
        It appears to have a memory leak so I need to download valgrind and fix
        it.

    Done:
        -   vector.erase()
        -   vector.search() 
                -   This could be more efficient if I sort it the vector

    Fixed with valgrind:
        -   constructors and deconstructor
        -   upSize(): bad pointer call when initializing new values in vector 
                      array 
    
    Having issues with:
        -   backPosition can't return null and be printed out, so I added m_null = 7777777
            This is hacky and meant to be a place holder until it can be worked out
    
    Next Steps:
        -   More testing to make sure functions all work
        -   Figure out how to declare a vector<type> i.e. vector<int> a(5);
