    Other:
    -   Only working with an int, no other type def
    Done:
    -   .size() and .capacity()
    -   .Resizing
        -   working between array of size 1, to size 402653184 (2^29 * 3/4).
            This includes bot upSize() and downSize()
    Having issues with:
    -   .first() need to deal with the case of .first() = NULL
    -   .back() need to deal with it's special case of size = 0 vector
    -   overloading "<>" 
    Next Steps:
    -   Finish:
        -   .push_back() I have most of the basic code written, it just needs
            to be debugged and polished.

    -   Added "frontPosition()" and "backPosition" to help move through the array, 
        because front()/back() returns the value and not the address. 
    -   Completed front()/back() to function properly
    -   Updated a testing functions and printing the vector with all it 
        characteristics out. 
    -   Working on push_back when it goes to line 120: newVectorPtr = new int[newSize];
        It appears to have a memory leak so I need to download valgrind and fix
        it.
