-   Other:
    -   Only working with an int, no other type def
-   Done:
    -   .size() and .capacity()
    -   .Resizing
        -   working between array of size 1, to size 402653184 (2^29 * 3/4).
            This includes bot upSize() and downSize()
-   Having issues with:
    -   .first() need to deal with the case of .first() = NULL
    -   .back() need to deal with it's special case of size = 0 vector
    -   overloading "<>" 
-   Next Steps:
    -   Finish:
        -   .push_back() I have most of the basic code written, it just needs
            to be debugged and polished.
