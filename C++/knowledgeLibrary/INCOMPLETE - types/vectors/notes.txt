notes:
    -   dynamically changes it's size, so when declaring you do NOT have to 
        declare the size
    -   This re-sizing isn't very efficient, so keep that in mind 

important:
    -   When ever moving or passing a vector, you need to pass it by reference
        so the whole vector isn't coppied over: 
                void Function(const std::vector<Vertex>& vertices){}
