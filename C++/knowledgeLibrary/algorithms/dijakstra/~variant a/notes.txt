Notes:
    - Cannot be used if edges have negative weight
    - Versions: 
        - "Lazy" Dijkstra's
        - 

Algorithm:
    - Initialize all distances to get to each node from node A to infinity
    - Assign start node to be 0
    - Visit all nodes directly attached to node 0, and reassign shortest distances IF they are shorter
    - Visit the next most promising node in the priority queue
