This folder is dedicated to learning about Dijkstras algorithm and how CoffeeBeforeArch
went about executing this. Most of this code is from "CoffeeBeforeArch", if not 
all of it. This code is meant to be a reference and the video can be found in 
the link below. See "References" for specific videos.
