    Vector vs Set:
        Below is a list of pros and cons on choosing to use vectors or sets. 
        I think I'm going to use vectors because I'm not sure what I will need
        quite yet, so more control is safer. If I find I can use sets, I'll go 
        back and swap it. I'll probably regret this decision if that happens.
            Sets: 
                Pros:
                -   Always ordered, no matter what is added/removed
                -   Quick to insert/remove
                -   No duplicates
                Cons:
                -   Less control

            vectors: 
                Pros:
                -   Much more control
                Cons:
                -   Hard to insert and remove, and takes time proportional to 
                    the items already in vector to do so

    PROGRESS OVERVIEW:
        Graph Class:
            -   Holds vector of Vertex Classes
            -   .addVertex()
        Vertex Class:
            -   Copy/Move functionality
    
    ISSUES:
        Space/Speed:
        -   Better way than to copy Graph Class into main
        -   Eliminate all copy's in Vertex.h

    NEXT STEPS:
        -   add adjacent vertices to the vertex class
        -   add adjacent weights to the vertex class
