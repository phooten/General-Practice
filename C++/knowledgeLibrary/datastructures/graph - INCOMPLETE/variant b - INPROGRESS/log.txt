    Vector vs Set:
        Below is a list of pros and cons on choosing to use vectors or sets. 
        I think I'm going to use vectors because I'm not sure what I will need
        quite yet, so more control is safer. If I find I can use sets, I'll go 
        back and swap it. I'll probably regret this decision if that happens.
            Sets: 
                Pros:
                -   Always ordered, no matter what is added/removed
                -   Quick to insert/remove
                -   No duplicates
                Cons:
                -   Less control

            vectors: 
                Pros:
                -   Much more control
                Cons:
                -   Hard to insert and remove, and takes time proportional to 
                    the items already in vector to do so

    PROGRESS OVERVIEW:
        Graph Class:
            -   Holds vector of Vertex Classes
            -   .addVertex()
        Vertex Class:
            -   Copy/Move functionality
    
    ISSUES:
        Space/Speed:
        -   Better way than to copy Graph Class into main
        -   Eliminate all copy's in Vertex.h

    NEXT STEPS:
        -   add adjacent vertices to the vertex class
        -   add adjacent weights to the vertex class

    PROGRESS OVERVIEW:
        Graph Class:
            -   Added a function to search for a particular node
            -   Added a function to add a Adjacent name and weight to a vertex
                in the graph
        Vertex Class:
            -   Added a function to search for a adjacent node
            -   Added a function to add an adjacent name and weight to this
                vertex list
        To think about:
            -   To organize better, maybe try to think about what Graph needs, 
                then base what Vertex handles from the view point of the Graph.
                not everything will need to accessable and poked with, except
                from the Graph's point of view. 
            -   Do you really want remove capabilities with the graph? the purpose
                would mainly be to search through, so the question is: Is it easier
                to make a new Graph? or easier to change? If the answer is easier 
                to change then you don't need remove functionality.

    NEXT STEPS:
        -   Clean up
        -   Before adding anymore functions, figure out why you are building this. 
            What functionality is needed from the Dijestras algorithm? Once you knnow this,
            you can figure out if you need to be able to search search for, and 
            if it in Graph, or in Vertex.
