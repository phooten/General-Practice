    -   I feel like I'm rewriting what I've already done in variant b ....
    Next Steps:
        -   Comment/Format Code

    Varaint A vs B:
        I don't think there is too many differences. I think i'll end up just 
        using variant A and archive B as a version 1.0, and this is 2.0, maybe?
        Either way, I plan on using one of the two when working on Dijkstras 
        algorithm. 
    Next Steps:
        -   Figure out what the move and copy constructors/overloaded operators
            are called, what they do, why they are needed, etc. I have a general
            understanding but still lack some context. Then comment these

    Updated:
        Functionality for Dijkstras algo:
        
        -   Graph.h/Graph.cpp:
            -   std::vector<Vertex> get_verticesVector() const;
                    To copy the contents outside the class
            -   Name changes to allow easy readability
        
        -   Vertex.cpp/Vertex.h
            -   std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> get_adjacentVertices_vector();
                    To copy the contents outside the class
            -   Name changes to allow easy readability
