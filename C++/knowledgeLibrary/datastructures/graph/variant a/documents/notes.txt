Uniform initialization
    -   Allows vectors to be initialized using curly braces


Degrees:
    -   Amount of paths connecting a vertex
    
Eularian:
    -   Eular Graph:
            IF there is a closed trail which includes every edge of the graph
    -   Euler Path:
            Path that uses every edge of a graph exactly once. It starts and 
            ends at differtent vertices
    -   Eular Circuit:
            Uses every edge of a graph exatcly once. Always starts and ends at 
            the same vertex. A connected graph is an Euler graph if and only if
            all Vertices are of even degree, and a connected graph is Eulerian
            if and only if its edge set can be decomposed into cylces
