    -   Somewhat of a continuation on "2_...2020.cpp". Ran code and got the first
        linked list right, but also got a seg fault right after. I'll probably have
        to valgrind if I can't visually check my code, so I'm taking a break for tonight. 
        I have a much better grasp on this after drawing everything out.

    -   The memory leak was caused on line 106: " while(tmpHead->next != NULL){ ... etc.
        When the "insertAtEnd" function was called and it was an empty list, there was
        No tmpHead->next, so it was accessing illeagal memory. I created an if statement 
        to counter this, but there is probably a better way to counter this. I'll probably 
        look into this next time I work on this. Other than that, the code runs well and 
        I have a much better understanding of this code.
