    -   created what I believe to be a doubly linked list. I havent been able to 
        test if everything is linked correctly or not. The program takes an input
        as "n" total elements. Each number after is taken as an input and added to
        the end of the list. The next step is to sort the list.

    -   started writing a delete function node function. It works except for the edge
        cases of the initial node and the final node, expectedly.

    -   I had tons of memory leak, but was able to resolve all issues without valgrind. 
        there are many checks I haven't accounted for, so for now just assume the 
        inputs are what would be expected. The deleting of nodes function is 
        complete and the next step is to sort the list with a function. Ideally I'd love to 
        learn merge sorting and use it.
