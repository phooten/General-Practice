This folder is dedicated to learning about Vectors and how the standard c++
library went about writting them. Most is this code is from "The Cherno". This
code is meant to be a reference and used to compare to the original vector class
I made. Most of the examples were written while following this youtube channel. 
See "References" for specific videos.
