-   Templates isn't actually real code. The code is only written when the 
    function is called. When it is called, with the type that we want to use, 
    then the function is written. It doesn't exist untill we call it.

-   Every time a template is called with a different type, a new function is
    created with the type used. 

-   template<typename T>
    -   Here, type name is the template param, and T is the name which could
        be anything.

-   typename vs class:
    -   In the context of templates, these are synonomous, and either can be 
        used. Typename is prefered for readability purposes.
