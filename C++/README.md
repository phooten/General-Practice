C++ Folder 
==========

This folder is dedicated to learning about the c++ coding language and different
concepts, algorithms, datastructures, practices, etc. that go along with it. It 
is not meant for anything other than a learning tool. While I'm learning, why 
not share?


### Table of Contents
Documents:
    
    Description:
        Contains personally helpful details specific to c++.


Knowledge Library:

    Description:
        All the different algorithms, datastructures, types, and other c++ specific
        concepts that interested me enough to record them. This is where a majority
        of the code will be.
