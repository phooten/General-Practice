# TODO [ 11-26-2021 ]
1. Move todo / data over to azure, github, notion, or gitlabs
2. Fix README.md's
3. Clean up C++ / Python.... Again.....
4. Learn:
   a. Virtual Functions
   b. Maps ( also unordered )
   c. Sets
5. Clean up "Challenge" in a consistant format


C++ Folder 
==========

This folder is dedicated to learning about the c++ coding language and different
concepts, algorithms, datastructures, practices, etc. that go along with it. It 
is not meant for anything other than a learning tool. While I'm learning, why 
not share?


### Content Descriptions
Archive:
    
    Description:
        Old documents I'm not ready to delete yet


Challenges:
    
    Description:
        Practice problems from sites like 'leetcode' and 'hackerrank'. Please 
        **PLEASE NOTE: 
            As with everything in this repo, I tried to note when I referenced 
            or used someone elses code. All of the first attempts / solution A's 
            are my own attempts without outside help. 


Documents:
    
    Description:
        Contains personally helpful details specific to c++.


Knowledge Library:

    Description:
        All the different algorithms, datastructures, types, and other c++ specific
        concepts that interested me enough to record them. This is where a majority
        of the code will be.

Utility:
    
    Description:
        This folder is for files or cases I use often. 
        i.e. -> randomly generate an array of 'x' size between 'y' and 'z'

* [**The Cherno - Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw): All things c++, Graphic Engines, and programming. I find his channel VERY helpful. 
* [**Jamie King - Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCda_RJU9-xB0Hswcrjn4SKw): All things c++, Graphic Engines, and programming. Unfortunatley he stopped posting in 2016, but his channel is still a good resource.
