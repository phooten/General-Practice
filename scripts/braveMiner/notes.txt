Issues:
	- 	Description: 
			(running wsl 2, fresh from boot up)
			./runBat.sh : 
				"	Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified		"
					Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused
					# Failed to parse arguments: Cannot open display:
					0
			echo $DISPLAY :
				x.x.x.x:0
			xeyes :
				"	Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified		"
					Error: Can't open display: x.x.x.x:0
		Solution:
			Uninstalled then reinstalled vcxsrv. I think next time try to force quit in task manager then try to run
			vcxsrv again and use xeyes to test

Notes:
	chrontab:
		- crontab -e 				: adds a new task to run
		- sudo service cron start 	: starts running cron
		- sudo service cron start 	: starts running cron
		- service cron status 		: shows cron status
